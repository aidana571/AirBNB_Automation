Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely used for building applications. Known for its platform independence, Java runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), allowing code to execute on various devices. Its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy makes it a favorite for developers working on mobile, desktop, or web applications. Core features include strong typing, garbage collection, and a rich standard library for tasks like networking, data structures, and GUIs. Java is also popular for enterprise solutions, boasting frameworks like Spring and Hibernate. With its vast ecosystem, Java remains relevant for modern development in finance, gaming, and cloud computing.
